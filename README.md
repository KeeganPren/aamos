# AAMOS

It's not a typo, it's an acronym; Another AVR Microcontroller OS (AAMOS)...

# OK, But Why?

There are a bunch of tiny little operating systems out there for exactly this application, probably a lot better than this one too.  You're right, but that's not the point.

Firstly, I lost my job and needed something to do while I was job searching.  Secondly, I wanted to prove to myself that I could.  I've worked in management a long time, like "Bro, do you even code?"

In addition to doing what any self respecting nerd would do with their unemployment, there were also some specific skills and concepts I wanted to explore and brush up on in the context of embedded systems development, in no particular order:
- Using CMake
- Unit Testing, using GoogleTest
- Doxygen Usage
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Code Coverage with gcov
- Performance Profiling with gprof

# Project Goals

This whole undertaking is largely an academic one.  My goals are to refresh and update some skills, and learn.  If the results are useful to others that would be great, but it is not my goal to create the next [FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/).

My goals can more or less be summarized as follows:

1. Refresh my own programming skills and get caught up on some old and some new tools.
    - Use CMake
    - Use GoogleTest
    - Use gcov
    - Use gprof
2. Experience TDD in a practical sense rather than an academic one.
3. Examine ways to document the software.
    - Document interfaces with Doxygen
    - Document behavior through tests
    - Document concept and architecture through TBD
