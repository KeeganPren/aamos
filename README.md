# OK, But Why?

Well firstly, I lost my job and needed something to do while I was job searching.  Secondly, I wanted to prove to myself that I could.

In addition to doing what any self respecting nerd would do with his unemployment, there were also some specific skills and concepts I wanted to explore abd brush up on in the context of embedded systems development, specifically:
- CMake
- Unit Testing
- Doxygen Usage
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration (CI)
