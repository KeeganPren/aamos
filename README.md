# AAMOS

It's not a typo, it's an acronym; Another AVR Microcontroller OS (AAMOS)...

# OK, But Why?

There a bunch of tiny little operating systems out there for exactly this application, probably a lot better than this on too.
You're right, but that's not the point.

Firstly, I lost my job and needed something to do while I was job searching.  Secondly, I wanted to prove to myself that I could.  I've worked in management a long time, like "Bro, do you even code?"

In addition to doing what any self respecting nerd would do with his unemployment, there were also some specific skills and concepts I wanted to explore abd brush up on in the context of embedded systems development, in no particular order:
- Using CMake
- Unit Testing, using GoogleTest
- Doxygen Usage
- Test Driven Development (TDD)
- Continuous Integration (CI)
- Code Coverage with gcov
- Performance Profiling with gprof

# Project Goals

1. Refresh my own programming skills and get caught up on modern tools.
    - Use CMake
    - Use GoogleTest
    - Use gcov
    - Use gprof
2. Experience TDD in a practical sense rather than an academic one.
3.
